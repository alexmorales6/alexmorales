    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Open xd<p>
    <p>Create an artboard 1024x768<p>
    <p>On your artboard create a rectangle that is 900x500 <p>
    <p>Make your rectangle green with the outline in black,(outline size 3)<p>
    <p>THESE FOLLOWING SHAPES WILL ALL REMAIN INSIDE YOUR 900X500 RECTANGLE
        YOU JUST CREATED.<p>
    <p>Also, before proceeding to create more shapes, right click on the 900x500
      rectangle and right click then press "send to back." This is so that the
      other shapes will be visible as you lay them on top of the rectangle.<p>

   <p>Make two rectangles that are 130x245, with the outline in black,(outline size 3)<p>
  <p>Place one rectangle on the left side
    (pay attention to the pink numbers that appears as you drag the the rectangle)<p>
  <p> As you line the rectangle along the side the pink numbers should be 123, 63, 132 â€“ if you do not see the numbers get it as centered as you possibly can<p>
  <p> Repeat this step with the second rectangle on the other side<p>
  <p> Create a circle with the dimensions of 200x200<p>
  <p> Place the circle in the middle of the rectangle as centered as possible<p>
  <p> Inside the circle, place your initials with your favorite font with a text size that will still fit inside the circle<p>
